Tech needs for Brooke piece.
 
Each musician will be provided with a small attaché case, something like this:

The attaché case will contain everything needed for the performance, including stand, light, and amplification. Each briefcase will need a small 1Ž4 inch mono or stereo out, which I may run through Bluetooth. 
 
The performers will move the briefcases, and sit on the floor; the cases, and their lighting/projection will be a part of the visuals as much as the dance.
 
For ideal amplification, there will be a back-of-the-house mixer with 16 channels
for amplification over a standard stereo pair. A smaller, “acoustic” version with Honeytone amps may be developed for use in Indonesia.
 
The performance space needs a hangable grid and lighting plot. Approximately 10-15 specials will be needed for the Brooke piece alone. However pieces beside Brooke's will have other static "looks" so a flexible, resident lighting plot would also be helpful. A lighting design will be provided to each venue, and when needed, a lighting board operator.
 
The stage floor can be flat black, Marley, or sprung wood, without obstructions, as the dancer will be performing barefoot. Glow tape will be applied to the floor.
