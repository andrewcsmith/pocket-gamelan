      In 2014, the percussion sextet Talujon will present â€œPocket Gamelan," an evening-length show that take its cue from Indonesian composers who have transformed the gamelan through instrument building, installation art, and multi-media approaches.  Talujon re-imagines the gamelan as a makeshift and dynamic instrumentarium, comprised of parts gathered from the surrounding environment.

      This multimedia event will feature a new work by groundbreaking composer and founding Bang on a Can All-star Evan Ziporyn, and a premiere by genre-busting composer Nick Brooke, choreographed and danced by the renowned Javanese dancer Mugiyono Kasido. The show will also feature work by Indonesian composer Dawa Alit with a film by Indonesian filmamker x, and an installation piece by the Balinese maverick I Made Subandi, in which toy gamelan parts are assembled to create a surround-sound experience.
