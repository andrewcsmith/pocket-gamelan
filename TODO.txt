Things that still need to be added:

- Add link with PDF of tech requirements under The Program

Things that are still required from Talujon:

- Cool photo of Dewa Alit, preferably a performance photo, but not one that makes him seem super traditional. Does he have a photo from some theatre piece, or event like that?

Back-end:

- Make the audio player cooler.
